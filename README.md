# odin-js-tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe implemented in JavaScript for The Odin Project

It's tic-tac-toe, quite a basic game that we all know. In its current state, all basic functionality you'd expect is there for two people to be able to play the game together.

To-Dos:
* Allow player custom naming
* Make the X's and O's a bit more visually appealing
* Add a basic opponent AI so you don't need a second player to play
